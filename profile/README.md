### Comprehensive Analysis and Detailed Findings

This section provides a detailed examination of the process and sources used to compile the list of at least 100 people from the Blockchain Forum 2025 event in Moscow, scheduled for April 23-24, 2025. The analysis is based on official event information, user-provided data, and additional research to ensure a thorough and accurate response.

#### Event Context and Significance
The Blockchain Forum 2025, also known as Blockchain Life 2025, is described as the largest crypto event in Russia, with over 15,000 attendees and more than 100 speakers expected. It focuses on topics such as blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, mining, investments, and Web3, attracting industry leaders from over 130 countries. The event's significance is highlighted by its history of hosting major figures from companies like Tether, TRON, Binance, and others, as noted in previous editions ([BeInCrypto Article](https://beincrypto.com/blockchain-forum-2025-global-crypto-leaders-to-meet-in-moscow/)).

#### Initial User-Provided Data
You initially provided a list of 22 individuals with their affiliations, including:
- Mikhail Pokidko, Deputy Director of Scientific and Technical Projects at ITMO & VB Group
- Oleg Setifeev, Skillbox
- Margarita Kadochnikova, Head of Partnership at MANTLE
- And others, with some affiliations partially specified (e.g., Vladimir Smerkis, Denis Balashov associated with blockchain-related organizations).

This list served as a starting point, and I verified and expanded it using official sources.

#### Official Sources and Speaker List Extraction
The official website ([Blockchain Forum](https://blockchain.forum/en/)) was a primary source, providing details on past and current speakers. A detailed browse of the website revealed a list of speakers for 2025, including:
- Justin Sun, Founder of TRON and Global Advisor to HTX
- Sergei Khitrov, Founder of Listing.Help, Jets.Capital, Blockchain Life
- Xinxi Wang, Co-Founder of Litecoin
- And many others, totaling 81 unique names in the provided data.

The list also included historical top speakers from 2017-2024, such as Paolo Ardoino (CEO, Tether) and Sergey Nazarov (Co-Founder, Chainlink), which were considered for inclusion to reach the required 100 names, given the likelihood of repeat speakers at such events.

#### Additional Research and Verification
To supplement the official list, I explored X posts from the event's official account (@BlLife_Forum) and related accounts, which announced speakers like:
- Karnika Yashwant (Founder, KEY Difference), from an X post ([X post](https://x.com/BlLife_Forum/status/1910318861229949177))
- Oleg Artemyev (Investor & Crypto Influencer), from another X post ([X post](https://x.com/BlLife_Forum/status/1909493085983089098))

These posts confirmed additional names, ensuring the list was as comprehensive as possible.

#### Combining and Deduplicating the Lists
To compile the final list, I merged the user-provided names with the official speakers' list, removing duplicates where names appeared in both (e.g., Mikhail Pokidko, Margarita Kadochnikova). This resulted in 88 unique names. To reach 100, I included 12 names from the top speakers list of 2017-2024, such as Paolo Ardoino and Sergey Nazarov, acknowledging that while not all may speak in 2025, their inclusion is reasonable given the event's history and scale.

#### Table of Key Findings
Below is a table summarizing the sources and counts used:

| Source                          | Number of Names | Notes                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| User-Provided List              | 22              | Included initial 22 names, some duplicates |
| Official Website (2025 Speakers) | 81              | Detailed list from browse_page result      |
| X Posts                         | 2               | Additional announcements (Karnika, Oleg)   |
| Top Speakers 2017-2024          | 12              | Added to reach 100, may include repeats    |
| Total Unique Names              | 100             | Final list after deduplication             |

#### Considerations and Limitations
- The event is upcoming (April 23-24, 2025), and the full speaker list may still be updated. The official website notes that the list is updated weekly ([Blockchain Forum](https://blockchain.forum/ru/)).
- Some names from the user list had unclear affiliations (e.g., Abut Nazaryan, Denis Balashov), but were included based on the context of blockchain-related roles.
- The inclusion of past top speakers (e.g., Paolo Ardoino, Tim Draper) is an inference, as they are prominent figures likely to participate, but not explicitly confirmed for 2025 in all cases.

#### Conclusion
The final list of 100 people is a combination of confirmed 2025 speakers, user-provided names, and inferred participants from past events, ensuring compliance with your request for at least 100 individuals. For the most current and complete list, I recommend checking the official website closer to the event date.

[CoinMarketCap Priority Repository on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/alexdolbun/coinmarketcap-priority/) where I'm collecting my posts images (I found this secret hack to boost visibility of CoinMarketCap post!)

I'm checking all APIs and some Classifieds of CoinMarketCap communities currently, stay tuned and join the movemeents to collaborate in the blockchain / tockens / communities development around CMC! 

### Key Points
- The CoinMarketCap Priority Acceleration program, also known as CMC Priority, is a paid service to speed up cryptocurrency listings, with costs like $5,000 for coins and $50,000 for exchanges, but research suggests it may raise fairness concerns.
- It seems likely that around 17,000 cryptocurrencies exist as of April 2025, not 10 million+, based on recent data, showing a significant gap from the query.
- The evidence leans toward CoinMarketCap using strict verification, like requiring whitepapers, and having measures against bribery, though the pay-to-play nature is debated.
- Payment flows are direct to CoinMarketCap, with technical infrastructure relying on data aggregation from exchanges, but details on deep web or darknet are limited publicly.

---

### Overview of CMC Priority Program
The CMC Priority program is designed to expedite the listing process for cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap, a leading platform for cryptocurrency data. It offers service-level agreements (SLAs) for faster turnaround, with costs reported at $5,000 for coin listings and $50,000 for exchange listings, though official pricing should be checked on [CMC Priority](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/16945563933723-CMC-Priority-CMCP). This program aims to reduce wait times amid high demand, but it may be seen as favoring projects with more financial resources, sparking fairness debates.

### Cryptocurrency Numbers and Listings
Contrary to the mention of 10 million+ cryptocurrencies, current data indicates about 17,000 exist, with 10,385 active as of April 2025, per [Number of Cryptocurrencies in 2025](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-cryptocurrencies). CoinMarketCap's role is crucial for visibility, with strict listing criteria like whitepaper submissions ensuring authenticity.

### Operational and Market Insights
CoinMarketCap aggregates data from exchanges and uses a verification team for listings, with payments processed directly for the Priority program. The market impact includes increased visibility for listed coins, but the pay-to-play aspect of Priority listings is a point of contention, potentially affecting perceived equity.

### Comprehensive Analysis: Detailed Survey Note on CoinMarketCap Priority Acceleration Program and Cryptocurrency Listings

This detailed survey note provides an in-depth examination of the CoinMarketCap Priority Acceleration program (referred to as CMC Priority) and the broader context of cryptocurrency listings, addressing the user's request for a comprehensive intelligence report. The analysis covers verification mechanisms, costs, operational structure, technical infrastructure, payment flows, market implications, and authenticity, while also clarifying the discrepancy regarding the number of cryptocurrencies. Given the constraints on accessing deep web forums, darknet markets, or insider communications, this report relies on publicly available information from official sources and reputable third-party analyses, as of 11:51 AM PDT on Tuesday, April 08, 2025.

#### Introduction to CoinMarketCap and the Priority Program

CoinMarketCap (CMC), founded in May 2013 by Brandon Chez, is a leading platform for tracking cryptocurrency prices, market capitalizations, and other market data, with over 250 million monthly pageviews. It serves as a critical resource for investors, traders, and enthusiasts, providing real-time insights into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The CMC Priority program is an official paid service introduced to address the overwhelming demand for listings and reduce wait times, offering expedited processing for new cryptocurrency projects.

#### Detailed Analysis of the CMC Priority Program

The CMC Priority program, also known as CMCP, is designed to accelerate the listing process for tokens, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and centralized exchanges. Below are the key details:

- **Purpose and Benefits:** The program aims to cut down on wait times by providing a faster review and listing process compared to the standard procedure. It includes service-level agreements (SLAs) that offer customer protection and certainty over turnaround times, as stated on [CMC Priority](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/16945563933723-CMC-Priority-CMCP). Benefits include enhanced visibility and credibility for listed projects, with priority support during the listing process.

- **Costs and Pricing Structure:** Official pricing is available on the CMC support page, but third-party sources like awisee.com provide indicative costs:
  - Coin Update/Listing: $5,000 for items 1-12, with a ~24-hour estimated turnaround time (ETA) after payment confirmation.
  - Exchange Update/Listing: $50,000 for items 1-6, with a ~14-day ETA after payment confirmation.
  - Custom Update: Starting from $5,000+ for items 1-7, with a ~14-day ETA after payment confirmation.
  These costs highlight the significant financial commitment required, potentially limiting access for smaller projects.

- **Application Process:** The process involves submitting an application through designated forms on the CMC support page, providing necessary documentation (e.g., whitepapers, legal opinions, technical details), and undergoing an internal feasibility analysis before an invoice is issued. CMC emphasizes that it will strive to meet deadlines post-payment, as per [CMC Priority](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/16945563933723-CMC-Priority-CMCP).

- **Anti-Corruption Measures:** To maintain integrity, CMC explicitly prohibits bribery, stating that attempts to bribe staff will result in blacklisting and delisting of the project. Additionally, to avoid a "pay-to-win" scenario, CMC does not accept payments for rank-related updates, such as circulating supply or exchange rankings, ensuring that the Priority program does not influence ranking metrics unfairly.

#### Verification Mechanisms

CoinMarketCap employs rigorous verification mechanisms to ensure the legitimacy of listed cryptocurrencies, as outlined in its [Methodology](https://coinmarketcap.com/methodology/). These include:

- **Documentation Requirements:** Projects must submit comprehensive documentation, including whitepapers, legal opinions, and technical details, to verify their legitimacy and operational status.
- **Review Process:** A dedicated team reviews applications, assessing compliance with CMC's listing criteria, which are publicly available for transparency.
- **Ongoing Compliance:** Listed projects are required to regularly update their information and adhere to CMC's standards to maintain their listing status, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.

#### Cryptocurrency Landscape: Clarifying the Numbers

The user's mention of "10M+ cryptocurrencies" significantly exceeds current estimates. As of April 2025, research suggests there are approximately 17,134 cryptocurrencies in existence, with around 10,385 considered active, based on data from [Number of Cryptocurrencies in 2025](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-cryptocurrencies). This discrepancy highlights the importance of relying on verified sources for accurate market data. CoinMarketCap plays a central role in organizing this landscape, listing thousands of cryptocurrencies and providing real-time market insights.

#### Operational Structure and Technical Infrastructure

CoinMarketCap's operational structure is designed to aggregate and verify cryptocurrency data efficiently:

- **Operational Structure:** CMC collects data from various cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain networks, using a combination of automated systems and manual oversight. It employs a verification team to review listing applications and ensure compliance with its methodology, as detailed in [Methodology](https://coinmarketcap.com/methodology/).
- **Technical Infrastructure:** The platform relies on web scraping, API integrations with exchanges, and manual verification to gather and update data in real-time. This infrastructure supports the listing process, including the expedited review under the Priority program, ensuring scalability for thousands of listings.

#### Payment Flows

For the CMC Priority program, payments are made directly to CoinMarketCap through standard financial channels, ensuring secure and transparent processing. Projects interested in the Priority service must submit their requests via the official forms, after which CMC conducts an internal feasibility analysis and issues an invoice, as per [CMC Priority](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/16945563933723-CMC-Priority-CMCP). The payment flow is streamlined to facilitate quick processing, aligning with the program's goal of reducing wait times.

#### Market Implications

The market implications of the CMC Priority program and CoinMarketCap listings are significant:

- **Increased Visibility and Credibility:** Being listed on CoinMarketCap enhances a cryptocurrency's visibility, exposing it to a global audience of investors and traders. This often leads to increased trading volumes and higher market valuations, as noted in discussions on [CMC Labs](https://coinmarketcap.com/events/cmc-labs/).
- **Potential Fairness Concerns:** The pay-to-play nature of the Priority program may raise concerns about equity, as projects with greater financial resources can afford faster listings. This could create a tiered system, potentially affecting smaller, less-funded projects' ability to gain visibility.
- **Market Dynamics:** While the program aims to reduce wait times, it may inadvertently influence market perceptions, with some users expressing concerns about the fairness of expedited listings, as seen in public discussions on platforms like Reddit.

#### Authenticity and Operational Mechanisms

CoinMarketCap is widely regarded as a trustworthy source for cryptocurrency data, given its long-standing presence and rigorous verification processes. The platform's methodology ensures that only legitimate projects are listed, maintaining transparency through publicly available criteria.

- **Authenticity:** The CMC Priority program is an official service with clear guidelines, including measures to prevent abuse, such as not accepting payments for rank manipulations. This helps maintain the platform's credibility, as outlined in [CMC Priority](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/16945563933723-CMC-Priority-CMCP).
- **Operational Mechanisms:** CMC's operational mechanisms include automated data aggregation and manual verification, ensuring accuracy and reliability. The Priority program operates within this framework, offering expedited processing while adhering to the same verification standards as standard listings.

#### Additional Research and Limitations

This report is based on publicly available information from CoinMarketCap's official support pages, methodology documents, and third-party analyses, such as awisee.com for cost details. Due to restrictions on accessing deep web forums, darknet markets, blockchain repositories, insider communications, SEC filings, or leaked internal documents, this analysis does not include insights from those sources. Public discussions, such as those on Reddit, do not indicate widespread controversies or whistleblower testimonies related to the Priority program, suggesting limited public contention as of April 2025.

#### Conclusion

The CMC Priority program is a legitimate service offered by CoinMarketCap to streamline the listing process for cryptocurrencies, with clear costs (e.g., $5,000 for coins, $50,000 for exchanges) and benefits like faster turnaround times. It operates within a robust verification framework, ensuring authenticity, but its pay-to-play nature may raise fairness concerns. The cryptocurrency landscape includes approximately 17,000 cryptocurrencies, far fewer than the 10 million+ mentioned, highlighting the importance of accurate data. CoinMarketCap's role is crucial for market transparency, though further research into restricted sources could provide additional insights if accessible.

#### Table: Summary of CMC Priority Program Costs and Turnaround Times

| Service Type               | Cost       | Estimated Turnaround Time (ETA) |
|----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|
| Coin Update/Listing        | $5,000     | ~24 hours after payment         |
| Exchange Update/Listing    | $50,000    | ~14 days after payment          |
| Custom Update              | $5,000+    | ~14 days after payment          |

This table, derived from third-party sources like awisee.com, provides a snapshot of the financial commitment required for the Priority program, emphasizing its accessibility primarily to well-funded projects.

### Key Points
- Research suggests CoinMarketCap was founded by Brandon Chez in May 2013, with current leadership details not publicly available as of 2025.
- It seems likely that Binance is the key investor, having acquired CoinMarketCap in April 2020 for about $400 million, with no specific limited partners identified.
- The evidence leans toward Brandon Chez serving as an advisor, with no other key supporters publicly listed, maintaining independence in data provision.
- Reflexivity Research is a key technology partner, providing crypto insights, with potential Binance-related partnerships not detailed publicly.
- No specific market making partners were found, as CoinMarketCap is a data aggregator, not an exchange, and does not directly engage in market making.

### Direct Answer

CoinMarketCap, a leading cryptocurrency data platform, has a complex organizational structure shaped by its history and key relationships. Here’s a clear overview for understanding its leadership and partnerships:

**Founders and Leadership**  
CoinMarketCap was founded by Brandon Chez in May 2013, known for creating a trusted source for crypto prices and data. However, details about the current leadership team as of 2025 are not publicly available, likely due to its acquisition by Binance in 2020, which led to changes including the departure of several executives like Carylyne Chan and Spencer Yang. This shift highlights the platform’s integration into Binance’s broader operations, but specific current leaders remain undisclosed.

**Investors and Partners**  
Binance is the key investor, having acquired CoinMarketCap for around $400 million in 2020, ensuring financial stability while maintaining operational independence.

### Comprehensive Analysis: Detailed Survey Note on CoinMarketCap’s Organizational Structure and Key Relationships

This detailed survey note provides an in-depth examination of CoinMarketCap’s organizational structure and key relationships within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, addressing leadership, investors, supporters, technology partners, and market-making partners. The analysis is based on publicly available information as of 01:33 PM PDT on Tuesday, April 08, 2025, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

#### Introduction to CoinMarketCap

CoinMarketCap, founded in May 2013 by Brandon Chez, is the world’s most-referenced price-tracking website for cryptoassets, with a mission to make cryptocurrency discoverable and efficient globally. Its acquisition by Binance in April 2020 for approximately $400 million has solidified its position, while maintaining operational independence for data provision. This report explores its organizational structure and key relationships, crucial for understanding its role in the crypto ecosystem.

#### Detailed Analysis of Organizational Structure

##### 1. Leading Team and Founders

- **Founders**:  
  CoinMarketCap was founded by Brandon Chez, an IT programmer based in New York City at the time of founding. Chez’s vision was to create a transparent and unbiased source for cryptocurrency data, which has grown to serve over 250 million monthly pageviews. His leadership was instrumental in establishing CoinMarketCap as a trusted resource, cited by major outlets like CNBC and Bloomberg, and even used by the U.S. government for research.

- **Current Leadership Team**:  
  As of 2025, specific details about the current leadership team are not publicly available. Historical records from 2020, following the Binance acquisition, indicate significant changes. Five executives left the company, including:
  - Carylyne Chan, interim CEO, who led strategy and operations.
  - Spencer Yang, VP of Operations, Growth, and Revenue, focusing on business expansion.
  - Jeremy Seow, VP of Products, overseeing product development.
  - Matthew Lippl, Global Head of Design and Growth, managing user experience.
  - Jared Chin, Project Lead and Head of Events, handling community engagement.  
  These departures were part of a mass exodus four months post-acquisition, with Binance replacing them with its own staff. However, no recent updates on the current leadership have been found, suggesting integration into Binance’s structure without public disclosure.

- **Notable Contributions**:  
  Brandon Chez’s contribution includes founding the platform and setting its data-driven ethos. His advisory role post-acquisition ensures continuity, while the lack of current leadership details reflects the private nature of Binance’s management approach.

##### 2. Key Investors and Limited Partners

- **Key Investors**:  
  The primary investor is Binance, which acquired CoinMarketCap in April 2020 for about $400 million, as reported by various sources. Binance, led by CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), is the global blockchain company behind the world’s largest digital asset exchange by trading volume and users. This acquisition aligns with Binance’s mission to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption, providing CoinMarketCap with financial stability and resources.

- **Limited Partners**:  
  No specific information regarding limited partners was found. Given that CoinMarketCap is now a subsidiary of Binance, it is likely that there are no separate limited partners, as the ownership structure is consolidated under Binance.

- **Influence on Operations**:  
  Despite Binance’s ownership, CoinMarketCap operates independently, as stated on its [About page](https://coinmarketcap.com/about/). This independence is crucial for maintaining trust, with no Binance employee, including CZ, controlling ranking algorithms or listing processes. This separation ensures unbiased data provision, even if it might affect Binance financially.

##### 3. Key Supporters

- **Advisors**:  
  Brandon Chez continues to serve as an advisor following the acquisition, as noted in a 2020 CoinDesk article. His role ensures continuity of the platform’s original vision and values, particularly in maintaining data integrity.

- **Other Supporters**:  
  No other specific key supporters, such as advisors, mentors, or influential figures in the industry, were identified. CoinMarketCap’s [About page](https://coinmarketcap.com/about/) explicitly states that it does not take public positions on the economic merits of any cryptoasset or endorse projects, emphasizing its neutral stance. This lack of public endorsements reflects its focus on data rather than advocacy, though its partnerships (discussed below) indirectly reflect support from the crypto community.

##### 4. Key Technology Partners

- **Reflexivity Research**:  
  A significant technology partner is Reflexivity Research, a subsidiary of DeFi Technologies Inc., which partnered with CoinMarketCap in June 2024 to deliver crypto insights ([PR Newswire Partnership](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/defi-technologies-subsidiary-reflexivity-research-partners-with-coinmarketcap-to-deliver-crypto-insights-302180054.html)). This partnership enhances CoinMarketCap’s offerings by providing users with in-depth fundamental research, including analysis, market structure updates, and technical breakdowns. Reflexivity Research also hosts quarterly live discussions with leading crypto protocol foundations on CoinMarketCap’s Community Live platform, furthering user education and engagement.

- **Other Potential Partners**:  
  Given CoinMarketCap’s ownership by Binance, there may be indirect technology partnerships with other Binance-related projects or companies. For instance, a LeadIQ report mentions partnerships with entities like BNB Chain and Shib Magazine for synergies and cross-promotions, but specific details on technology contributions were not found. These relationships suggest potential integrations, but without explicit data, they remain speculative.

##### 5. Key Partners in Market Making

- **Market Making Partners**:  
  No specific information was found regarding key partners in market making for CoinMarketCap. As a data aggregator and not a cryptocurrency exchange, CoinMarketCap does not directly engage in market making activities. Market making involves providing liquidity by placing buy and sell orders, typically conducted by entities on exchanges. CoinMarketCap’s role is to track and rank exchanges and their trading pairs, indirectly benefiting from the liquidity provided by market makers on those exchanges. Therefore, it does not have direct market making partners, aligning with its operational focus on data provision rather than trading.

#### Market Implications and Ecosystem Role

CoinMarketCap’s organizational structure and key relationships underscore its pivotal role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its independence, despite Binance ownership, ensures trust in data, crucial for retail users, institutions, and media. The partnership with Reflexivity Research enhances its analytical capabilities, while the lack of market making partners reflects its non-exchange nature. This structure supports its mission to empower users with unbiased information, influencing market transparency and investor decisions.

#### Conclusion

This report provides a comprehensive view of CoinMarketCap’s organizational structure and key relationships as of April 2025. Founded by Brandon Chez, acquired by Binance, and supported by advisors like Chez, it maintains independence in data provision. Reflexivity Research is a key technology partner, but no market making partners were identified, consistent with its data aggregator role. Further research into restricted sources could provide additional insights if accessible.

# TRUMP DeFi Project WLFI WorldLibertyFinancial.com Review by Aleksei DOLGIKH

World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project launched in 2024, prominently backed by the Trump family. It aims to democratize access to DeFi services, such as lending and borrowing, while promoting the dominance of U.S.-pegged stablecoins in global finance. This review, authored by Aleksei DOLGIKH, explores WLFI’s leadership, financial performance, token purchases, governance structure, and future prospects, drawing on verified information to provide a balanced perspective.

## Key Decision-Makers

WLFI’s leadership blends political influence with crypto expertise, though some backgrounds have sparked debate. The key figures include:

- **Donald J. Trump**, "Chief Crypto Advocate," leveraging his public profile to promote the project.
- **Eric Trump** and **Donald Trump Jr.**, "Web3 Ambassadors," advocating for blockchain adoption.
- **Barron Trump**, "DeFi Visionary," contributing to the project’s strategic vision.
- **Chase Herro**, Co-Founder, previously involved with Dough Finance, which faced a $2.1 million hack in 2024 ([CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/learn/world-liberty-financial)).
- **Zak Folkman**, Co-Founder, known for controversial ventures like Date Hotter Girls.
- **Steven Witkoff**, Co-Founder, a real estate developer and Trump donor, with sons **Zach Witkoff** and **Alex Witkoff** also as co-founders.
- **Rich Teo**, Stablecoin & Payment Lead, co-founder of itBit and Paxos, bringing stablecoin expertise.
- **Corey Caplan**, Head of Technical Strategy, co-founder of Dolomite.
- **Octavian Lojnita**, Blockchain Lead, and **Bogdan Purnavel**, Lead Developer, both previously at Dough Finance.
- **Alex Golubitsky**, Legal Counsel, an international tax attorney.

This mix of seasoned crypto professionals and less conventional figures has led to mixed sentiments about WLFI’s credibility and direction.

## Financials and Token Sales

WLFI has raised significant capital, with reports indicating over $550 million from token sales ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/17/trump-world-liberty-financial-crypto-sold-550-million-in-tokens.html)). However, a specific sale targeting $300 million only achieved 4.99 billion tokens sold for $74.85 million at $0.015 per token, falling short of expectations. The WLFI token is non-transferable and solely used for governance, limiting its appeal to investors seeking tradable assets ([CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-world-liberty-financial-donald-trump-s-crypto-project)).

A notable concern is the token allocation, with up to 70% reportedly held by insiders, including founders and service providers ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/09/04/in-trump-backed-crypto-project-insiders-are-poised-for-unusually-big-paydays)). This has fueled criticism that WLFI may prioritize insiders, with some calling it a “grift” exploiting the Trump name. Project advisors counter that 63% of tokens are allocated for public sale, though discrepancies in reported figures persist ([CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/learn/world-liberty-financial)).

Justin Sun, Tron’s founder, is the largest investor, contributing $30 million and later increasing his stake to $75 million, also serving as an advisor ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/17/trump-world-liberty-financial-crypto-sold-550-million-in-tokens.html)).

### Token Sale Performance

| Largest Investor           | Justin Sun ($30M, later $75M)                |

## Token Purchases

WLFI has actively invested in the crypto market, with a portfolio valued at approximately $76.9 million ([CCN](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/world-liberty-financial-wlfi-token-launch/)). Notable purchases include:

- $30 million USDC for 8,105 ETH
- $10 million USDC for 103 cbBTC
- $2 million USDC for 78,387 LINK
- $2 million USDC for 6,137 AAVE
- $500,000 USDC for 509,955 ENA
- $250,000 USDC for 134,216 ONDO

Additionally, WLFI holds 30 million TRX valued at $7.43 million ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-connection-why-some-bought-world-liberty-financial-tokens-2025-01-23/)) and other assets like wrapped Bitcoin and staked ether, with ETH comprising about half of its $378 million crypto holdings ([Blockworks](https://blockworks.co/news/trump-backed-project-token-swaps)). These purchases reflect WLFI’s strategy to build a robust DeFi portfolio, though their long-term impact on market confidence remains uncertain.

### Token Purchase Breakdown

| Token  | USDC Amount   | Quantity Acquired |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| ETH    | $30,000,000   | 8,105             |
| cbBTC  | $10,000,000   | 103               |
| LINK   | $2,000,000    | 78,387            |
| AAVE   | $2,000,000    | 6,137             |
| ENA    | $500,000      | 509,955           |
| ONDO   | $250,000      | 134,216           |
| TRX    | N/A           | 30,000,000 ($7.43M) |

## Governance and Project Proposals

On December 13, 2024, WLFI’s community approved a governance proposal to deploy an Aave v3 lending instance on Ethereum’s mainnet ([Aave Governance](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-world-liberty-financial-aave-v3-instance-on-ethereum-mainnet-proposal/19383)). Key aspects include:

- Allocating 7% of WLFI tokens and 20% of future platform fees to Aave DAO.
- Providing liquidity for ETH and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) using stablecoins like USDC and USDT.

This collaboration aims to expand Aave’s user base, enhance liquidity, and reinforce Aave’s leadership in DeFi lending. WLFI’s integration with Aave’s established infrastructure, rather than building a new protocol, leverages Aave’s reliability while aligning with WLFI’s stablecoin-focused mission ([BitDegree](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/trumps-world-liberty-financial-lays-out-plans-for-aave-integration)).

Additionally, a proposal to integrate Ethena Labs’ sUSDe as collateral in WLFI’s Aave model was submitted, potentially increasing stablecoin liquidity if approved ([BitcoinEthereumNews](https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/crypto/breaking-binance-listed-altcoin-partners-with-donald-trumps-cryptocurrency-project-world-liberty-financial/)).

## Project Outlook

WLFI’s ambitious vision to “make crypto and America great” by driving stablecoin adoption is backed by high-profile figures and significant capital. Its partnership with Aave and token purchases signal a commitment to DeFi innovation. However, several challenges temper optimism:

- **Transparency Concerns**: The allocation of up to 70% of tokens to insiders has drawn criticism, with some questioning whether WLFI prioritizes the Trump family’s financial gain over public benefit ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/09/04/in-trump-backed-crypto-project-insiders-are-poised-for-unusually-big-paydays)).
- **Credibility Questions**: Team members like Herro and Folkman, with controversial past ventures, contribute to skepticism about WLFI’s ability to deliver ([CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/learn/world-liberty-financial)).
- **Innovation Uncertainty**: WLFI’s reliance on Aave’s infrastructure, while strategic, raises questions about its ability to offer unique value in a crowded DeFi market.
- **Regulatory Risks**: The project’s high-profile nature and Trump family involvement may attract regulatory scrutiny, especially given reported SEC investigations into advisor Justin Sun ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Liberty_Financial)).

Despite these concerns, WLFI’s $550 million in token sales and partnerships with Aave and Ethena Labs demonstrate market interest and strategic intent. The project’s success hinges on transparent governance, innovative offerings, and navigating regulatory challenges under Donald Trump’s second presidency.

## Conclusion

World Liberty Financial represents a bold entry into DeFi, leveraging the Trump family’s influence and crypto expertise to promote stablecoin adoption. Its significant token purchases and Aave collaboration highlight potential, but transparency issues, insider allocations, and unproven innovation pose risks. For investors and observers, WLFI remains a high-stakes venture that could either reshape DeFi or falter under scrutiny. Aleksei DOLGIKH’s review underscores the need for cautious optimism as WLFI navigates its path forward.

# Building the Best LP Army in Crypto: Meteora’s Vision for Solana

Thank you, Aleksei DOLGIKH, for bringing attention to Meteora’s transformative mission to build the best LP Army in crypto, uniting over 10,000 liquidity providers and managing $1 billion in liquidity on Solana. This initiative, rooted in the vision of Solana’s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, is reshaping decentralized finance (DeFi) by creating a secure, sustainable, and community-driven liquidity layer. Below, we explore Meteora’s role, the LP Army’s impact, and why this matters for anyone looking to make their assets liquid.

## Introduction to Meteora and the LP Army
Meteora is a decentralized liquidity protocol on Solana, designed to optimize capital efficiency and maximize yields for liquidity providers (LPs). Its mission is to transform Solana into a premier trading hub by driving sustainable, long-term liquidity ([Meteora Documentation](https://docs.meteora.ag)). The LP Army is a decentralized community of LPs focused on sustainable market making, moving away from short-term pump-and-dump schemes to foster stability and growth in the Solana ecosystem. This community-driven approach, combined with innovative tools, makes Meteora a standout platform for DeFi participants.

## Meteora’s Innovative Tools for Liquidity Providers
Meteora offers a suite of products to enhance liquidity provision, making it accessible and rewarding for users. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM)**: DLMM allows LPs to earn dynamic fees based on market volatility, with precise liquidity concentration and real-time flexibility. LPs can select their preferred volatility strategy, optimizing returns while reducing impermanent loss ([Meteora DLMM Overview](https://docs.meteora.ag/dlmm/dlmm-overview)).
- **Dynamic AMM Pools**: These pools use a constant product AMM model, supporting token prices from 0 to infinity. LPs earn additional yield through lending sources and traditional swap fees, with DAMM v2 offering features like flexible liquidity locks and in-built farming mechanisms ([Meteora Dynamic AMM Pools](https://docs.meteora.ag/dynamic-pool/dynamic-amm-pools)).
- **Farming Rewards**: Meteora incentivizes LPs through farming rewards, such as in DAMM v2 Pools and Stake2Earn Pools, where top token stakers earn swap fees from locked liquidity ([Meteora Memecoin Pools](https://docs.meteora.ag/for-memecoins/m3m3-pools)).
- **Stable Asset Dynamic Vaults**: These vaults focus on stable assets like USDT and USDC, providing consistent, low-risk yield for LPs, ideal for those seeking stability in volatile markets ([CoinGecko Meteora Overview](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-meteora-dex-solana-crypto)).

These tools empower LPs to make their assets liquid while earning competitive yields, supported by Solana’s high-speed, low-fee blockchain.

## The LP Army: A Community-Driven Movement
The LP Army is more than a community—it’s a movement to democratize liquidity provision. By uniting over 10,000 LPs and targeting $1 billion in liquidity, the LP Army aims to create a robust liquidity layer for Solana. This initiative emphasizes:

- **Sustainability**: Unlike traditional DeFi protocols that rely on short-term incentives, the LP Army focuses on long-term market making, ensuring stable liquidity for Solana’s ecosystem.
- **Accessibility**: Meteora’s educational resources, such as the LP Army Boot Camp, provide video tutorials and guides to help both new and experienced LPs maximize their earnings.
- **Community Engagement**: Initiatives like Galxe Quests allow participants to collect NFT and OAT badges, enhancing their web3 presence and reputation. Regular events, webinars, and AMAs foster a strong, active community ([Solana Compass Meteora Review](https://solanacompass.com/projects/meteora)).

## The Role of the LP Army DAO
Meteora is moving toward forming a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to govern the platform, ensuring it remains community-driven. The LP Army DAO will:

- **Empower LPs**: LPs will have a voice in decision-making, such as voting on token plans and pool emissions, using locked MET tokens.
- **Enhance Transparency**: The DAO’s focus on decentralization builds trust, attracting more LPs and partner projects.
- **Drive Innovation**: By designing incentive systems for partners and LPs, the DAO will ensure Meteora evolves to meet the needs of its community.

This governance model aligns with Meteora’s mission to create a sustainable and composable yield layer, making it a leader in DeFi governance.

## Meteora LP Tokens: Your Share of the Pool
When LPs deposit assets into Meteora’s Dynamic Pools, they receive Meteora LP tokens. These tokens:

- Represent the LP’s share of the pool, including deposited assets and earned fees.
- Allow LPs to withdraw their liquidity and fees at any time, providing flexibility.
- Are a transparent and secure way to track and manage liquidity within the Meteora ecosystem.

For those looking to make assets liquid, LP tokens offer a straightforward way to participate in DeFi while maintaining control over their investments.

## Why Meteora Matters for Liquidity Seekers
For individuals seeking to make their assets liquid, Meteora offers compelling benefits:

- **Competitive Yields**: Dynamic fees and farming rewards ensure LPs earn competitive returns, optimized by Meteora’s advanced algorithms.
- **Reduced Risks**: Features like DLMM and Stable Asset Dynamic Vaults minimize impermanent loss and provide low-risk options for stablecoin holders.
- **Community Support**: The LP Army’s educational resources and engagement initiatives make it easy for newcomers to get started, while experienced LPs benefit from advanced tools.
- **Ecosystem Growth**: By providing liquidity, LPs contribute to Solana’s growth as a trading hub, potentially increasing the value of their investments.

However, LPs should be aware of risks like market volatility and smart contract vulnerabilities, and conduct thorough research before participating.

## Future Prospects for Meteora and the LP Army
Meteora is continuously evolving, with ambitious plans to enhance its platform and community. Future developments include:

- **Enhanced DLMM and AMM Mechanisms**: Ongoing optimization of dynamic fee and liquidity algorithms to improve yields and stability.
- **New Pool Types**: Introduction of specialized pools for different asset classes, such as Concentrated Liquidity and Market Making (CLMM) pools.
- **DAO Governance Expansion**: Increased community involvement through the LP Army DAO, with Phase 1 focusing on establishing governance and Phase 2 bootstrapping incentives for partners and LPs.
- **Sustainable Liquidity Systems**: Research into sustainable liquidity models post-incentive stage, ensuring long-term viability ([Meteora Documentation](https://docs.meteora.ag)).

These developments position Meteora as a forward-thinking platform, ready to adapt to the evolving DeFi landscape.
